# Payroll and Team Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between payroll allocation and team performance across multiple seasons (1990-2020). The objective is to assess whether higher payroll investments are associated with improved performance outcomes and to support strategic resource allocation decisions.

## Data
The analysis is based on three datasets containing:
- Team payroll information
- Season performance indicators
- Teams' historical changes (Relocations, ...)

All datasets are provided in the `data/` folder.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using R and includes:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Construction of performance indicators
- Statistical analysis to explore relationships between payroll and performance
- Comparative evaluation across teams and seasons

The full R script is available in the `code/` folder.

## Results
The results are summarized and interpreted in a detailed analytical report, available in PDF format in the `report/` folder.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open `NBA Analysis.R` in R or RStudio
3. Ensure the working directory is set to the project root
4. Run the script to reproduce the analysis and results

## Tools
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)
